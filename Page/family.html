            <h1>TO MY FAMILY</h1>
            <p>I would love to send this message especially to two people who always nurture, care for, protect, advise, teach, and educate me to be a good person, no matter what kind of person I am. Being a parent is one of the most challenging jobs in the world, but you are always there to support us in every situation. It is not enough to say thank you because your love for all children is priceless. I want to say that I love you both very much. You are the God of all children, no matter how difficult it is, you both do not abandon us, even if we make mistakes, you always love us. Thank you for everything my beloved parents and family.</p>
